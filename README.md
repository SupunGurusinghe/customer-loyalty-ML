<h2>Introduction</h2>

Retail supermarkets constantly need to know about their customers and shopping behavior. The idea is simply to retain their loyalty and at the same time stretch them to spend more and attract more new customers.

A customer can become loyal only when he/she feel personalized: when they get things from supermarket according to their needs. For example if a customer buys a lot of cereals from a particular brand, upon receiving a discount on his/her next purchase for the very same item, he/she will feel valued for being loyal to the supermarket. More a customer becomes loyal, more deeper the supermarket can dig in his/her shopping behavior so as to keep on deliveing the good customer experience.

In retail, above practice is done by marrying cocnepts like Customer Segmenatation with Personalization. Not only retails; but industries like media, telecommunications, avaiation, financial institutions, insurance, automobiles all over the world are trying to retain this loyalty by focussing their microscopic lens towards the customers shopping behavior. Among them retail industry can do it better just because their data is huge.
